# lezer-markdown

This is an incremental Markdown
([CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), in fact) parser that
integrates will with the [Lezer](https://lezer.codemirror.net/) parser
system. It does not in fact use the Lezer runtime (that runs LR
parsers, and Markdown can't really be parsed that way), but it
produces Lezer-style compact syntax trees and consumes fragments of
such trees for its incremental parsing.

Note that this only _parses_ the document, producing a data structure
that represents its syntactic form, and doesn't help with outputting
HTML. Also, in order to be single-pass and incremental, it doesn't do
some things that a conforming CommonMark parser is expected to
doâ€”specifically, it doesn't validate link references, so it'll parse
`[a][b]` and similar as a link, even if no `[b]` reference is
declared.

## Interface

This module exports a `MarkdownParser` class, which represents an
in-progress parse. It extends
[`IncrementalParser`](https://lezer.codemirror.net/docs/ref/#lezer.IncrementalParser).

 * **`constructor`**`(input: Input, options?: Object)`

   Create a Markdown parser. The following optional options are
   recognized:

   * **`startPos`**`: number`\
     The position at which to start parsing. Defaults to 0.

   * **`fragments`**`: TreeFragment[]`\
     A set of tree fragments (aligned with the input) to use for
     incremental parsing.

   * **`nodeSet`**`: NodeSet`\
     The node set to use in this parse. Defaults to
     `MarkdownParser.nodeSet`. Can be used to pass a set with
     additional props added.

 * **`advance`**`(): Tree | null`\
   Move the parser forward. Will either use a chunk of content from
   the given fragments, or parse one leaf block. Returns the finished
   tree when the entire document has been parsed.

 * **`forceFinish`**`(): Tree`\
   Retrieve the tree for an unfinished parse.

 * **`pos`**`: number`\
   The current parse position.

 * `static `**`nodeSet`**`: NodeSet`\
   The set of node types used in the output.

 * `static `**`Type`**`: enum`\
   The enum holding the node types (their numeric values correspond
   to the node type ids).
